# First challenge

This challenge has used [angular seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) to create the angular project and [vue-rangedate-picker](https://bliblidotcom.github.io/vue-rangedate-picker/demo/) as Vue element.

## Goal

The goal of this project is being able to communicate an angular component with a Vue one, even though I've tried, I couldn't make it work, the documentation about vue-rangedate-picker is not really good, it takes a lot of effort to understand it and also, I've the feeling it has some bugs.

All I could do was communicate the angular component with a Vue element (it displays the date picked from the angular component) and set the date picked from vue-rangedate-picker into the angular component.

## Run the challenge

Navigate to check-password folder and install the project

> npm i

and run

> npm run start

now in your browser could see the project running on ```localhost:8000```

## Warnings

Node version should be 10.x.x, in next Node version, angular seed doesn't work (I couldn't see node_modules folder)
